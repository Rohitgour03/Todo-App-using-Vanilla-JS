### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

- Concepts of functional programming
- Creating Custom checkbox inputs
- Adding the light/Dark theme


### Continued development

I learned to add the dark theme and light theme for the website and its good to have both themes on your webpage/website for user accessibilty and I will be trying to add the diffrent themes for my next projects.

### Useful resources

- [Custom Checkbox style](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-checkbox-style/) - This helped me in creating the custom checkbox by pure CSS. I really liked this approach and will use it going forward.
